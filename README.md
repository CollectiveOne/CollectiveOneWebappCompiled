# CollectiveOne Webapp

This is the webapp of www.collectiveone.org: 
CollectiveOne is a method (and a platform) to develop open, decentralized and collaborative projects: projects to which anyone can, potentially, contribute, and which are collectively owned and self-governed by their contributors. Projects in CollectiveOne include a “value accounting system”, so that contributions are recognized and valued using a project-specific token called “participation points”: the more you contribute to a project, the more you own and the more power you have over its decisions.

## **Contributions are welcome**
 
CollectiveOne wants to become a decentralized project itself, using the method it promotes. The best way to get involved is by getting in touch through [Slack](http://www.collectiveone.org/v//slack).
